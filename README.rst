Intro
-----

I am a emacs beginner, know little about elisp. I use emacs only when there's no other substitutions.

This is my personal configurations of emacs, maybe useful for emacs beginners.

Usage
-----

I am using emacs 25.3, so the following is only tested on this specific version.

* Compile and install emacs 25.3 (Please google)
* rm -rf ~/.emacs.d
* git clone https://github.com/windtail/emacs-config.git ~/.emacs.d
* open emacs, packages will be automatically installed from melpa (China mirror)
* enjoy it or not ^_^
